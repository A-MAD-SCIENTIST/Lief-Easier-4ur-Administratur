Make IT easy for noobs

Go to regedit, then Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

Change shell to anything other than explorer.exe as noobs can cause a lot of damage. In my case I've done steam.exe. Could be chrome.exe, outlook.exe, idk, experiment. When Windows boots, the explorer shell won't load and the desired application will load only. Make your troubleshooting life more easier wooo!
