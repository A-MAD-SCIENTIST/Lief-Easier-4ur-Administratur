Make IT easy for noobs

Go to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

Change shell to anything other than explorer.exe as noobs can cause a lot of damage. In my case I've done steam.exe. Could be chrome.exe, outlook.exe, idk, experiment. Make your troubleshooting life more easier wooo!
